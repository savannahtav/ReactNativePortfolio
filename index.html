      <!-- TODO App -->
      <div class="project mb-5">
        <h3>TODO App</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a TODO application using React Native. The application allows users
            to manage their tasks effectively by providing features such as task listing, task completion, and task addition,
            as well as having the ability to login or register for an account.</p>

        <p>The specific skills and technologies I utilized were React Native for building cross-platform mobile applications,
            AsyncStorage for local data storage, and various components from the React Native Elements library for UI elements.</p>  
            
        <p>One challenge I faced during development was managing asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from AsyncStorage
            and handling user interactions, in a synchronous and predictable manner. Asynchronous operations can introduce
            complexities, especially when dealing with state management and ensuring data consistency.</p>  
            
        <p>To overcome this challenge, I leveraged React Native's built-in asynchronous features, such as async/await syntax and
            the use of promises, to manage asynchronous tasks effectively. By structuring my code to handle asynchronous operations
            asynchronously and using error handling mechanisms, I ensured that the application remains responsive and robust even
            during data fetching and processing. Additionally, I adopted a modular and encapsulated approach to state management,
            using the useState and useEffect hooks provided by React Native. This allowed me to separate concerns and manage state
            changes in a clear and organized manner, reducing the likelihood of race conditions or data inconsistencies.</p>

      <!-- Exercise App -->
      <div class="project mb-5">
        <h3>Exercise App</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create an Exercise application using React. The application includes a menu with four
            different exercise options to choose from in which the user can either record laps with a timer or increase their rep count.</p>  

        <p>The specific skills and technologies I utilized were React for building the user interface components, useState and useCallback
            hooks for managing state and handling user interactions, and CSS for styling the components.</p>  
            
        <p>A problem I encountered during development was efficiently managing the state and transitions between different screens of the
            application. I addressed this issue by carefully designing the state management logic and using conditional rendering to switch
            between the menu screen and the exercise screen based on user interactions</p>

      <!-- Quiz App -->
      <div class="project mb-5">
        <h3>Quiz App</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a quiz application using React Native. The application allows users to answer a series
            of questions presented in various formats, including multiple-choice, multiple-answer, and true-false questions.</p>  

        <p>The specific skills and technologies I utilized were React Native for building the user interface components, useState and
            useEffect hooks for managing state and handling user interactions, and AsyncStorage for storing user responses locally on
            the device.</p>  
            
        <p>One challenge I encountered during development was accurately tracking and recording user responses for each question. Given
            the different question types and the need to handle both single and multiple correct answers, ensuring the correctness of
            user responses and calculating the final score presented a significant challenge. To address this challenge, I implemented
            a function to calculate whether the user's selected choices matched the correct answers for each question. By carefully
            comparing the user's selections with the correct answers and considering the question type, I was able to accurately determine
            the user's performance for each question and calculate the total score </p>
